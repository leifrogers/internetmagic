Totes rando collection of p5.js stuff I've made and collected into one big folder.

# Grids
There's nothing special here.  It makes a randomly colored grid.  whoo.

# Maze
Generates a maze then solves the maze.  Entrance is the top left, exit is the bottom right.

# Bubbles
Pink pixel bubbles floating up.  It makes me smile.

# Lines
Makes some randomly colored lines and moves them about...randomly.

# Falling Rows
Color shifting rows go down the screen.  Sorta trippy to watch for a prolonged amount of time.

# Painter
 is a bigger project but still mostly just a late night coding whim.  It's purpose is to be sort of like an 8bit pixel art painter thing.  I can't really define nor does it really need to be--I just wanted to do it in p5js.  It can be found in action <a href="https://leifrogers.github.io/internetmagic/painter/">here</a>
